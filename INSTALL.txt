Installing
==========

Before running, you're going to have to install the Stanford C++ libraries and Eigen, which is a linear algebra / matrix library. You could do this manually by making a "lib" folder and downloading the necessary libraries online.

Alternatively, I've gone ahead an shared a link to the complete lib folder with all necessary dependencies here:

After downloading, you can just drag the folder into final-project-submit/ (the new paths should be final-project-submit/lib/...). 

Platforms
=========

Currently, real-time user control only works on Windows. Hopefully the program should work on Linux and Mac without this feature, but it's as-of-yet untested.

Compiling
=========

Make sure you compile in release mode, otherwise learning will be very slow.
